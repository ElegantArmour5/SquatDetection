# SquatDetection

Squat Detection web app built using Flask and MediaPipe Library in python.

Current criteria for successful squat includes knee angle less than or equal to 90 degrees.

Feedback system classifies correct or incorrect and if incorrect provides reason (example: squat is too shallow).

# Future Improvements

1. Add more criteria for correct squat like knees behind toes, etc
